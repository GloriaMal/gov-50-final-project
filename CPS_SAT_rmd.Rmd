## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

correlation 

try to find the correlation of the percentage that are college ready compared to the 

i dont think this is going to be accurate becaus ein the past the two variables were calculates in a way where they were on the same scale and percentage level. 

```{r}
corr_sat_college_readiness <- cor(CPS_SAT$`Average Composite Score`, CPS_SAT$`Percent College Readiness`, method = "pearson")

corr_sat_college_readiness
